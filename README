Welcome to the Blue Crab Project!

Blue Crab is a project to bring the redundancy and search power of large-scale enterprise search systems to small businesses and households without the high up front costs of these enterprise search systems.

Blue Crab uses much of the PASTRY, PAST, and SCRIBE projects to implement storage and messaging.  Apache Tika and Lucene are used for search.
